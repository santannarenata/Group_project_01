# Healthcare Price Dispersion

##  Group project 01 - Members: Renata Sant'Anna, Ben Lamkin, David Johnson and Kabao Xiong 

### Goal

Our goal was to analyze whether there is price dispersion in diagnosis/procedures average prices among different states in US, different regions in Tennessee (TN) and different providers in Nashville, TN.

Also, we would like to analize if there was a correlation between volume (number of discharges) and price charged by providers.

# Group project 01

## Members: Ben Lamkin, David Johnson, Kabao Xiong and Renata Sant'Anna

**Project Proposal**

Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent scope creep.

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

- The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
- The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
- Possible source for such data

**Finding Data**

Once your group has written an outline, it's time to start hunting for data. You are free to use data from any source, but we recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:

- data.world
- Kaggle
- Data.gov
- Public APIs
- Awesome-APIs List
- Medium APIs List

Make sure that your data is not too large for local analysis. Big Data datasets are difficult to manage locally, so consider a subset of that data or a different dataset altogether.

**Data Cleanup & Analysis**

- The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: Exploration & Cleanup and Analysis proper.
- As you've learned, you'll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin to answer your research questions. 
- We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook, both for organization's sake and to make it easier to  present your work later.
- During both phases, don't forget to include plots!Creating them along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice otherwise.
- We recommend focusing your analysis on techniques such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.

**Presentation**

- After you've analyzed your data to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.
- This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and should give your classmates and instructional staff an overview of your work. PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are all acceptable for building slides.
- As long as your slides meet the presentation requirements, you are free to structure the presentation however you wish, but students are often successful with the format laid out in the presentation guidelines.
